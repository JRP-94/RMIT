									<h2>IT and Me</h2>
									<h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4>
									<p>For me, there isn’t no simple answer. I am deeply appreciative of all technological developments, past and present e.g Enigma machine, DeepCrack etc. They built and defines our modern era; The Information Age. If had to whittle it down to a few, my top interests would be the realm of Information Security and Programming. This includes cryptography, programming languages, network security, exploits, malware and data forensics. But my interest also extended to artificial intelligence as well as quantum and DNA computing. These areas excite me, as the possibilities of future technologies becomes endless and unimaginable.</p>
									<h4>When did your interest in IT start?</h4>
									<p>My interest in IT first began with game, more specifically a game called “Age Of Empires”. At the age of 3, I got a demo of the game in a box of Kelloggs Nutrigrain and It was from then on my obsession with Computer began. As time went on, my interests continued to expand further and further.</p>
									<h4>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h4>
									<p>My father worked in IT my whole life and I would watch him work, intrigued by it all. He worked as a technician for Telecom back when it was owned by the government. He then owned his own computer store and id watch him work in the school holidays, helping him where I could (often meant going down to the corner shop and buying us licorice). He’s now the IT manager for Australian and New Zealand for a large international German company. Through my life my father nurtured my curiosity with computers and IT, until it became an insatiable thirst for me to know everything, why things are the way they are and how things work. Over the years, I taught myself about encryption, malware, Basic programming, Circuitry and exploits. What lead me down this path was when I was about 10 years old I accidently downloaded a malware that was hidden in a macro in Microsoft Word and almost destroyed my computer and my dads very important work computer. I watched him rectify my stupidity, I was in awe of the process and how the program itself worked. </p>
									<h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT and what do you expect to learn during your studies? </h4>
									<p>It has a good reputation. It has a flexible study structure when studying online and allows me to not put my life on hold to be a student. Not only the structure of the degree but the electives available will aid me in my goals of landing my ideal job post-graduation and give me a strong foot hold in climbing the wall that is, the IT industry. Why I came to RMIT and what I expect to learn are almost one in the same. With the flexibility of structure comes the need to be self motivated, it will develop a higher level of time management and prioritising so that I can pass with a grade and transcript that reflects my true abilities. I hope to learn from my studies here what is absolutely necessity for someone entering the IT industry in this day and age. And above all, I hope that the degree will expose me and learn about all the different kinds of iterations of IT, from IoT to on metal programming , from Web design and databases to Security and scripting.</p>

									<h3>Ideal Career</h3>
										<p>My career aspiration is to work as a Penetration tester for a security firm or government agency. The role of a  Penetration tester is to test the security of Web-based applications, networks, devices and computer systems owned by a company or even the government.  They deploy a large assortment of tools and techniques to infiltrate and achieve their objective. These can include exploits, malware, phishing and social engineering. </p>
									<p>	<a href="https://jonothanbosworth.co.uk/vacancies/penetration-tester-2/">Here is a link to my ideal position</a>
										<a href="screenshot1.png">or heres the first screenshot</a>
										<a href="screenshot2.png"> and heres the second</a></p>
										<h4>Why are you interested in this career?</h4>
										<p>In our everyday lives we use an array of IT, including our phones, laptops, watches, cars and some people even have “smart” coffee machines (part of IoT devices). But sometimes these devices, these systems, come out of the oven half baked or security of the device hasn’t been considered properly. The potential security flaws leave us vulnerable to the less than honest people that lurk society. Being able to find these flaws and work with the developers to correct them is my aspiration, it’s what drives me to a career of working in Information security as a penetration tester. It will challenge me continuously to stay ahead of those with malicious intent, help provide a safer product, therefore a safe environment for consumers and satisfy that drive of continuously learning. It also scratches my inquisitive mind in the right place, for example, what if I could make this device do something its not designed to do and into something I want or need it to do.</p>
										<h4>Requirements of a Penetration tester</h4>
										<h5>Becoming a Penetration tester has many paths, but most employers looks for the following things:</h5>
									<p>- A bachelor or masters in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Technology or any relevant field.
										<br>
										- For junior positions, 1-3 years experience in the IT indu
										<br>
										- Certifications like Ethical Hacker Certification or Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)or similar</p>
										<p>These are considered the bare minimum and often employers require more, like strong command of multiple Operating systems (including Kali linux), experience with multiple different programming languages like C, C++, PHP, Python etc. The language requirements can vary from employer to employer. The position also requires Social Engineering skills as humans are often the most vulnerable part of security. Knowledge in software, firmware and hardware design are considered desirable, as well as networking and cryptography. On top of all this, experience with multiple essential tools like wireshark (wifi packet sniffer), Metasploit (exploit program) etc are a must.</p>
										<p>In addition to the technical side, as an individual you must have excellent communication skills to relay complex topics to your employer in the debrief as well as working efficiently and effectively in a team environment to achieve the common goal. The position also demands of the individual strong time management skills, excellent writing skills (for reports for the debrief), creativity, initiative and importantly integrity as you are working with highly sensitive information (if for the government a security clearance is often required).</p>
										<h4>My current experience</h4>
										<p>My current experience in the realm of information security is limited, I haven’t received any kind of formal or structure education outside my own curiosity. I have taught myself basic python, some hardware modification, basic untilisation of HTML, operating of Linux systems like Ubuntu, programming in C++ in the terminal of Ubuntu, Wifi packet-sniffing programs for monitoring my own wifi (I live alone, so its for any suspicious activity) and through my studies at RMIT im learning Java. </p>
										<p>Even though I have limited experience in Information security, my personal attributes align with those required to be successful in the field. In my few years, I have achieved a lot. I have developed extensive time management skills, high level of self-motivation, strong leadership qualities, even stronger ability to function effectively in a team environment, good communication skills and excellent social skills in general. These are all due to my achievements in Rugby Union, the Military, numerous management positions I have worked in, global travel and through my own initiative and constantly challenging myself.</p>
										<h4>My path</h4>
										<p>In order to achieve my goals, I have distilled a plan for myself with clear and precise steps I need to take. Firstly, I will continue my studies with RMIT, while studying my bachelors I will take the elective studies that are relevant to me, these include Cloud computing, Scripting Programming Language, Object-Orientated Programming with C++ and Web Development Technologies. In addition to the IT electives, my minor stream electives with be a mix of both Management and Cyber Security. </p>
										<p>After I graduate, I will apply for IT positions in Europe and aim for the bigger international companies. There I will learn how the information I learnt in my studies is applied and what is common practice in the industry in this day and age. It will hopefully expose me to a large number of commonly used programs etc with businesses, what the business culture is like. While working in the Industry I will evaluate the option of continuing my studies, and if I elect to study further my goal is to study a masters in Cyber security and data analysis. If I do a masters, after that I will gain the Ethical Hackers Certification and other relevant certificates required (Country dependent). </p>
										<p>Once I have gain a Bachelors of IT, Industry experience, a Masters in Cyber Security (potentially) and all the relevant certifications, I will start applying for jobs in the Information security sector, specifically a junior penetration tester position. From their I will work my way up the ladder and aim to achieve a senior Penetration tester position, hopefully this position with allow me to work. When I feel as though I have acquired all the relevant skills, information, contacts etc I will look to start my of Security firm. I will remain flexible with my plan and adjust at any time when required to do so.</p>

									<h2>My Profile</h2>
									<br>
									<h4>16 Personalities Test (Myer-Briggs)</h4>
									<p><b>Campaigners ENFP-A </b>
										<br>
											79% Extroverted – 21% Introverted
											<br>
											91% Intuitive – 9% Observant
											<br>
											71% Feeling – 29% Thinking
											<br>
											53% Prospecting – 47% Judging
											<br>
											63% Assertive – 37% Turbulent</p>
											<p>The Campaigner is the true “free spirit” personality type. People of this personality type 	dream BIG, are very creative and are highly sociable. They often bring high enthusiasm to every situation and end up finding themselves in leadership positions because of it. The strengths of this type are a deep innate curiosity, meticulously observant, energetic and enthusiastic and often spreads this excitement to others, excellent communication skills and extensive social skills.</p>
											<h4>Learning Styles Test</h4>
											<p><b>Kinesthetic-tactile learning style</b>
												<br>
												People who fit the Kinesthetic-tactile learning style require touching or manipulating whatever you want to learn. They best learn on the fly, by participating in the activity and learning as they go.
											</p>
											<h4>Leadership Skills Test</h4>
											<p><b>Communicating vision</b>
												<br>
												People of this type can envision clear and structured goals aligned with their direction for their team and communicate their plans in a way that excites others. They have the level of charisma needed to persuade people that their visions are worthwhile. People who excel in this area are innovative visionaries who are confident in their ability to persuade and convince others. They consider it essential to make those they lead aware of, as well as part of, their vision.
											</p>
											<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
											<p>While not whole heartedly, I agree with these results and their description of me. These results allow me to take a step back to identify my potential strengths and weakness. With that information I can then continue to work on making myself more well rounded and refined. It also allows me to have a better understanding of what I should be doing in a group environment and how I can maximise my and my teammates experience.</p>
											<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
											<p>In a team we are stronger together and when everyone works to their strengths and is covering each others weaknesses it will create synergy. Where the whole value is greater than the sum of the parts. With these results it is clear that I will most likely assume a position of leadership in a group environment but not as a dictator but more as a mediator for everyone qualities and how we can come together to achieve our true potential. As well as ensure that every member feels as though they are a leader in their own right and actively engage them in participating in the development of our goals</p>
							<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
							<p>I will be conscious of my short-coming and look for team members that compliment those weaknesses and I compliment theirs. One perspective isn’t enough and when everyone has a clear understanding and excitement of our common goals, we will be more productive as a whole. I will look for others who are equally creative and charismatic but also others that are logical and take the time to think, as they will ground me when I lose direction. </p>

						<h2>Project Idea: House-hold solar hydroponic garden</h2>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>My project is a Fully automated solar hydroponic garden aimed to be marketed at the public. I will be fully self suficent and only require the ower to harvest the vegetables and add the fertaliser when the tank becomes empty. It will know when to empty the water going through, it will monitor and control fertiliser concentrations in the solution, the system will monitor and charge a battery cell connected to the device so that it runs over night. It will have LED grow lights to maximise yield with the least amount of work.  It will aim to reduce the environmental damage of the agricultural industry, reduce the living cost per household, promote healthy eating with fresh food available directly at home.</p>
				<h4>Motivation</h4>
				<p>Currently, we live in an unsustainable world where almost every action we take, every little thing we buy creates a larger carbon (and other greenhouse gases) footprint than the earth can recycle. The agricultural industry is one of the biggest contributors to our current climate crisis. This not only includes the expulsion of methane, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide, it also includes mass deforestation causing population decline of many native Australian flora and fauna species. its also the poisoning of our vital waterways by the run off of fertiliser, creating algal blooms of cyanobacteria which deplete the water of oxygen and collapse complete ecosystems in the waterways. The motivation of the project is to reduce these devasting effects by putting the power in the hands of the citizens and creating less of a demand, therefore reduce the industry and its impact on the planet.</p>
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>The hydroponic system will be free standing and have one PVC pipe zigzag from top to bottom, this will be the plant ladder. A water pump with push the solution of water and soluble fertiliser through a clear plastic tube to the top of the PVC piping from a storage tank. Gravity will then pull the solution down the pipe and running gently over the root system of your plants back into the storage tank. The storage tank will be constantly monitoring the solution concentration and adjusting it for optimal yields. The system requires that is position in an area that receives adequate sunlight.</p>
				<p>The whole system will be encased in a clear plastic container, then a sensor will monitor air temp and moisture and adjust it accordingly by opening and closing vents in the case. When the sun sets or when the system is receiving limited sunlight (a sensor is responsible for detection), the LED grow lights will activate and a light shutter will encase the whole system, this will allow for maximum absorption by the plants and reduce wasted energy.</p>
				<p>After the optimal light exposure has been reached the LEDs will turn off and the shutters will retracted. All the electrical components will be connected to a battery cell and an external solar panel. The solar panel with charge the batteries and run the pump during the day and when the voltage of the panel drops too low it will switch to using the battery cell. When the plants are ready to be harvested, the owner will be notified via the mobile app as to which plant exactly is ready, each plant with have a slot allocation. </p>
				<p>To set up the system, the user will use the app to select the appropriate plants for the time of year and which plants grow best in the same conditions to optimise yields and limit (if any) wastes. The user will then place the plant into the allocated slot indicated by the app (and by a flashing Indicator LED) and close the system. The tank system will compromise of the main storage tank where the water and fertiliser solution is contained and connected to the main tank will be a tank containing the fertiliser for the system to use when adjusting the concentrations. </p>
				<p>In addition to the fertiliser tank being connected to the main tank, the main tank will be connected to a fresh water supply. When the tank needs to be cleaned, the app will notify the user and the user will initiated the cleaning program via the app. The pump will stop, the user will switch the pumps output from into the system to the drainage hose. The user will then connect the drainage hose to the pump and to wherever the user would like to dispose of the waste (preferably to an outside garden). Once ready, the user will click on a button in the app and it will go until its finished. When finished the user will be prompted again with the reverse of what they just did. </p>
				<h5>Tools and Technology</h5>
				<p><b>Plumbing</b>
					<br>
10m PVC piping (5cm diameter)
<br>
plumbing glue for the plant ladder
<br>
A medium 12v water pump
<br>

<br>
20x PVC pipe caps
</p>
				<p><b>Frame</b>
					<br>
Aluminium tubing 4x180mm x 30mm 4x 80mm x 30mm 4x500mm x 30mm
<br>
16x metal brackets
<br>
64x 35mm x 10mm bolts with nuts and washers
<br>
10x 110mmx10mm bolts with nuts and washers
</p>
				<p> <b>Case</b>
					<br>
4x hinges
<br>
2x 180mm x 80mm x 5mm Perspex plastic sheets
<br>
2x 180mm x 50mm x 5mm Perspex plastic sheets
<br>
2x 80mm x 50mm x 5mm Perspex plastic sheets
<br>
4x electric motor blinds
</p>
				<p><b>Electrical</b>
					<br>
1x temperature sensor
<br>
1x humidity sensor
<br>
1x spectrometer
<br>
1x luxmeter
<br>
50x small proximity senors
<br>
1x 12v medium size pump
<br>
2x 12v batteries
<br>
1x 300w 24v solar panel
<br>
1x raspberry pi 3 A+
<br>
4x raspberry pi zero w
<br>
Database server
<br>
6x square full spectrum LED light banks
</p>
				<h5>Skills required</h5>
				<p>In addition to all the parts listed above, the hydroponic system will require multiple different programs to be written for the front end and the back end. These include software to run all the sensors and then calculate the required adjustments for the system, then a program that takes this information and makes the adjustments in the system, like switching to the battery supply when the luxmeter reading is too low or when the sun has set, activate the blinds and the LED lights turn on. An operating system on the central control system (Raspberry Pi) is also required, a compatible mobile application and  a program to communicate with the server containing the database required for the whole hydroponic system itself, storage of data and for application.</p>
				<p>As the design of the system isn’t too complex and designed to be simple and straight forward the programs will follow suit. This should makes the project more feasible and likely to decrease the initial upfront cost and should increase adoption</p>
				<h5>Outcome</h5>
<p>It will hopefully provide households with fresh vegetables in a clean and efficient manner. It will be carbon neutral as it will run completely off solar energy. It will be fully automated and the only required input by the user is simple and cheap in hopes to increase adoption. In the future, the plan is to put the idea forward to the government and negotiate a subsidy scheme mirroring the solar energy scheme. In addition to addressing key environmental impacts it will also encourage healthier eating in every household that adopts this technology, addressing our obesity issue in Australia and in a trickle down kind of effect, reduce the strain on the healthcare system by lifestyle related diseases like diabetes and obesity, and free up funds and resources for other issues we face in Australia with an aging population.</p>
